    "description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The following relates to a folding residue management tool for a seeder useful in, but not exclusively for, no-till farming. More particularly, the folding residue management tool is able to fold into a non-working position when not needed to prevent wear on the tool, thereby extending the working life of the tool. BACKGROUND No-till farming (also called zero tillage or direct drilling) or cover crop farming is a way of growing crops from year to year without disturbing the soil through tillage. No-till is an agricultural technique which increases the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil and increases organic matter retention and cycling of nutrients in the soil. In many agricultural regions it can reduce or eliminate soil erosion. No-till seeding requires seeding into the previous year s crop residue and or cover crops, which presents a number of challenges to no-till farmers. Knife openers have become more popular than disc openers in no-till farming for several reasons. One reason is that, when using a disc to open the soil for the seed, the disc often pushes straw into the furrow where the seed is placed instead of cutting it. This is commonly referred to in the industry as  hair-pinning . Hair-pinning is common when using disc openers because the disc needs to be set to seed shallow. However, the disc needs to be set relatively deep to cut straw instead of hair-pinning it. Another reason why knives have become popular in no-till farming is that the knives also aerate and warm the soil by leaving a black strip for the seed to germinate in. Knives also leave a small furrow for the seed to grow in, and, therefore, the furrow protects the seedling and stays moist longer than the small groove left by a disc opener. Nevertheless, the use of knife openers in no-till farming may still be problematic when the residue is damp, or has long vines, etc. In these conditions, the knives will rake the straw up and sometimes plug the machine, thereby making seeding with knife openers more difficult. Hence, residue management tools are often used in these situations. Nevertheless, there still may be situations where the crop residue is such that a residue management tool is not needed. Further, there may be situations during seeding where a residue management tool is only needed for part of the field to be seeded and, in this instance, having a residue tool still operational when in low crop residue conditions may interfere with proper seed fertilizer placement. However, having to stop mid-seeding to remove a residue tool is laborious and time consuming. Thus, there is a need in the industry for a residue management tool that can be readily engaged when crop residue is problematic and readily disengaged when crop residue is manageable, without interrupting seeding fertilizing. SUMMARY The following relates to a ground-driven residue management tool to be used in conjunction with any seeding unit for reduced tillage, minimum tillage o",

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. 102024102279.5, filed Jan. 26, 2024, which is hereby incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates generally to a coupling arrangement for an agricultural tractor, comprising a drawbar having a first bar section, which is mounted in a longitudinally movable manner along a predefined adjustment region in a holder for attachment to an underside of a power-take-off transmission housing of the agricultural tractor, and a second bar section, which is situated opposite the first bar section and is guided within adjacent upper and lower supporting cheeks of a coupling carrier plate and can be fixed therein in one of a plurality of coupling positions along the predefined adjustment region by a securing element. BACKGROUND A coupling arrangement of this kind is known, for example, on agricultural tractors from the manufacturer John Deere. This comprises a drawbar having a first bar section and a second bar section situated opposite the first bar section. The first bar section is mounted in a holder on the underside of a differential housing of the agricultural tractor and is fastened therein by a removable pin, which extends through a bore formed in the first bar section and is screwed to the differential housing. Furthermore, in the region of an end plate carrying a coupling ball, the second bar section has left and right threaded holes for receiving associated hexagonal bolts, by which the end plate is screwed to a coupling carrier plate provided in the rear region of the agricultural tractor. The drawbar can be mounted in one of two different coupling positions by releasing the pin and the two hexagonal bolts, thus enabling various operating situations of an attachment attached to the coupling ball to be taken into account. Owing to the design, the vertical forces occurring at the drawbar during operation of the attachment act directly on the screw connection produced by the two hexagonal bolts, and therefore correspondingly high tightening torques are required here. These have the effect that transfer of the drawbar between the two coupling positions is possible only with a correspondingly high level of effort and is usually reserved for a workshop visit. In order to facilitate handling when moving the drawbar, DE 10 2023 104 695 A1 therefore proposes guiding the second bar section in a longitudinally movable manner within adjacent upper and lower supporting cheeks of a coupling carrier plate provided for rear attachment to the agricultural tractor. The drawbar can be moved in this case into a plurality of coupling positions by longitudinal movement and can be locked therein with respect to the coupling carrier plate by at least one securing element. The guidance of the drawbar in the region of the second bar section by the two supporting cheeks or upper and lower sliding surfaces formed thereon ensures that the vertica",

No. 29 954,983 filed on 30 Jul. 2024, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein in their entirety for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates generally to coupling device. In particular, the present disclosure relates, but is not limited, to a coupling device that is configured to connect equipment, in the form of a turf roller, to a towing vehicle. The present disclosure also relates to a method of coupling equipment to a towing vehicle. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Ride-on turf rollers, such as the type used on golf greens and fine turf surfaces on golf courses and sporting fields, generally have a plurality of rollers that press against and flatten the ground as the turf roller is in motion. These turf rollers are powered by a motor, and may have a seat for a user and at least one control, such as a control stick, steering wheel, foot pedal, switches, etc, to control the motion of the roller. The user conventionally sits facing perpendicularly to the direction of motion of the roller. When not in use, turf rollers are often transported between different locations, such as a storage location or other locations where turf is to be rolled. Ride-on turf rollers may have wheels which engage the ground when the rollers of the machine are not used such that the rollers are lifted away from the ground when the wheels are being used. Ride-on turf rollers may be placed onto a trailer to be towed by a vehicle. Otherwise, they may have an integrated connecting part which attaches to a hitch on a towing vehicle. The integrated connecting part may be fixed in position in some instances. There also exist ride-on turf rollers which have a folding connecting part assembly. When the roller is in use, the folding connecting part may be folded up and away from the ground. When the roller is not in use, the folding connecting part may be folded downwards to a position where it can be attached to a vehicle for towing. These folding connecting parts are manually moveable by a user between the in-use towing position and standby position. The folding connecting part may be indirectly connected to the wheels or axle(s) such that moving the connecting part into the in-use towing position also causes the wheels to engage the ground and the rollers to be lifted away from the ground. Similarly, folding the connecting part into the standby position will lift the wheels from the ground so that the rollers of the turf roller engage the ground. A number of compromises exist with current towing devices for ride-on turf rollers of the above type. For example, when a folding connecting part is moved to a standby position, it may partially obstruct the view of a user of the roller. The folding connecting part cannot generally be removed from the turf r",

    "description": "RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63 626,717, filed Jan. 30, 2024, and entitled,  Automatic Camera Position Calibration , hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND Cameras are omnipresent and used on mobile platforms for many uses such as automatic guidance or to collect information about the environment. It is necessary to know the position of the camera relative to the vehicle, implement, device or space it is mounted on or in so that visually identified objects of interest can be localized in 3D space. The localization may be in a relative space or some global coordinate system such as geodetic coordinates. This localization is necessary to log, reason about or act upon the objects of interest. Installation and calibration of the pose of these cameras is a challenge requiring precise measurement and purpose-built mounting devices. In some applications this process goes so far as to use laser measuring devices and takes hours to complete. Imperfect mounting, measurements or disturbances can render camera generated data inaccurate. While previous work demonstrates calibrating cameras using known images or checkerboards, they require a stringently well-lit environment and obstructive fiducials that require the user to undergo a specific calibration procedure. Although the present disclosure is not limited to application of automatic camera position calibration in the context of agricultural vehicles or implements, certain problems are amplified or exacerbated in this context. For example, the width of agricultural vehicles and their attachments or implements may be significant and different operations may be performed along the complete span of the agricultural vehicle, sprayers being one such example. In addition, an agricultural vehicle and its attachments may be performing field operations along a plurality of crop rows. For these reasons, precise measurement may be required and may not be readily achievable using methods discussed in prior art. Therefore, a better method or methods for automatic camera position calibration are needed. Particularly, methods which are convenient for vehicle operators while also being effective. SUMMARY Therefore, it is a primary object, feature, or advantage to calibrate a camera s pose relative to a vehicle or platform on which it is mounted by observing features of the vehicle. Another object, feature, or advantage is to avoid requiring a user to use only specific mounting locations for a camera which expands mounting options. Yet another object, feature, or advantage is to avoid costly or cumbersome calibration procedures by performing calibration without user input. A further object, feature or advantage is to provide calibration methods which are convenient to vehicle operators. A still further object, feature, or advantage is to calibrate a camera s pose relative to a vehicle it is mounted on in a convenient manner. A",

    "description": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to and the benefit of Brazilian Application No. BR102024002077-4, filed Jan. 31, 2024; the contents of which as are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND Technical Field The present invention is related to a disk unit applicable to agricultural equipment, particularly in soil preparation equipment, which adjusts the working pressure of the individual disks according to different needs or field conditions encountered. Description of Related Art Modern agricultural equipment used in soil preparation is equipped with individual disks (instead of the known sections of agricultural harrows) and has been preferred for performing high-speed tasks ( Speed Tillers ) for acting on crop residues in general. This preference for individual disks is due both to the fact that they have a large free span between them (providing a greater flow of straw debris), and to the ability of each disk to oscillate individually to overcome any obstacles found on the ground. In this individual disk equipment, for operation at higher speeds, the use of damping elements (Elastomers) installed between the support of said disks and the structure of the equipment prevails, so that they absorb the impacts from working on the agricultural field. Some relevant examples of documents that disclose this type of individual disk are U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,398,738, 11,330,752, and WO2004004438. Documents with damping carried out by compression or traction springs are also found, for example: U.S. Pat. No. 9,398,737; WO0219792 and CZ2021529. In arable soils, there are great variations in the texture and structure of these soils, in addition to the cultivation of different types of crops that provide different types of vegetation remaining on the soil after harvest. Thus, it is desirable to have agricultural equipment equipped with individual disks and with resources to adjust the cutting depth thereof, for its efficient performance in different soil textures (Sandy, Medium, Clay Soil), with an adequate adjustment range for the various working conditions of the equipment, which characteristics are not seen in the disk units of the state of the art. BRIEF SUMMARY A first objective of the present invention is to provide a disk device for soil preparation that allows the variation (adjustment) of the working pressure of the individual disks in order to adapt the working depth (penetration) to the different soil textures, resistance to cutting, as well as to the different types of vegetation remaining on the soil. This invention relates to a disk unit for agricultural equipment comprising a bracket configured to receive a profile of the agricultural equipment, the bracket comprising an upper projection and a lower projection; an arm with an upper end, a lower end, and an upper projection positioned near the upper end; a spring assembly with a rod that accommodates a spring, a guide, and a pressure nut s",

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method to manage the seed feeding process of a planter through a seed tender. In particular, the invention finds advantageous but not exclusive application in feeding a planter towed by a tractor and comprising a plurality of hoppers for the seed, to which the description below explicitly refers without any loss of generality thereby. BACKGROUND A planter is a farm implement used in farms that grow grain and forage-type crops. The function of the planter is to sow seeds into soil along a row or stripe of proper width for creating evenly spaced crop rows or stripes and metered seed gaps. The planter is usually towed by a tractor and comprises many containers for the seed to be sown. Each container comprises a box or bin and a respective lower hopper for the dropping of the seed into the soil. For that reason, in the technical field of farm implements these containers are also shortly named  hoppers . It is also known to use a seed tender for feeding seed into the hoppers of the planter. A seed tender is a farm equipment comprising a wagon provided with a big reservoir for seed, allowing for bulk quantities of seeds to be directly fed into the hoppers of the planter. The advantage of feeding the planters by means of seed tenders is to reduce the downtime for planting, which is very helpful in case of large fields to be sown, especially during short planting windows. Known seed tenders are normally fed manually by an operator and are provided with weighting systems. In case of a planter with many hoppers, the operator can set, on the weighing system of the seed tender, a target weight for the seed to be fed in each hoppers of the planter, and the seed tender is configured to stop the loading of seed into the hoppers as soon as the target weight is reached. Moreover, in case the planter is fed while its hoppers are not completely empty, it is possible to reduce the target weight for the hoppers. Everything else has to be done manually under the strictly control of the operator. Often, operators do not know in advance the capacity of the hoppers of the planters and so they are not able to set the target weight for the hoppers of the planter. Moreover, the target weight should be calculated on the basis of the specific weight of the seed, which may change with respect to the known nominal values (provided by the seed producer) due to the ambient conditions, such as humidity and temperature. In order to facilitate feeding operations, the seed tender is normally provided with a wireless remote control capable of sending command to a control unit onboard of the seed tender, said control unit being configured to control actuators of the seed tender. It is well known that remote controls ar",

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION Any and all priority claims identified in the Application Data Sheet, or any correction thereto, are hereby incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57. This application is a continuing application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 18 428,378 filed on 31 Jan. 2024, which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and is hereby expressly made a part of this specification. TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure relates generally to gardening devices, and more particularly to planters with devices for constructing furrows. BACKGROUND This disclosure relates to planters suitable for furrowing and or planting seed in a planting ground. In farming and gardening it is typically desired that seeds be planted in a manner so as to achieve high productivity. To achieve this, seeds need to be planted at particular depths and need to be spaced apart from each other by particular distances. For example, iceberg lettuce may need to be spaced ten inches apart to achieve a desired growth. Some types of seeds tend to germinate at a lower rate than others. For such types of seeds it is sometimes desired to plant groups of multiple seeds together and in close proximity to each other as insurance against non-germinating seeds, e.g. groups of two iceberg lettuce seeds, spaced two inches apart from each other, may be planted ten inches apart from each other. During planting season, achieving tight control over parameters such as those described above while maintain a high tempo of planting is challenging. In large-scale farming, seeds are commonly planted using large planting machines suitable for seeding multiple rows at a time. Plants planted by home gardeners and small farmers frequently show poorer performance because of lack of access to such automated planting machines; these machines tend to be complex, expensive, and often ill-suited for use on a small number of seed rows and or along short rows. Efficacious planters (planting devices) generally require the ability to handle a variety of seed sizes, and seed spacings along the planting ground (inter-speed spacings). Seeds are planted by first digging a hole or a furrow to a desired depth, then releasing one or more seeds, and then closing the hole or furrow. As mentioned above, furrows or holes need to be dug to a predetermined height. This height may depend on the type of seed that needs to be planted. Furrow openers are devices used to dig furrows (or  open  furrows). It is important for furrow openers to have the requisite rigidity to allow digging through the soil. For example, if not sufficiently rigid, furrow openers may bend and lead to failure in opening furrows or to improperly formed furrows. In many cases, the connection or coupling between the furrow opener and a handle or the rest of the planter may be insufficiently rigid, despite the furrow opener itself being highly rigid, e.g. the furrow opener may be made of steel, to yield a sufficiently ",

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 63 627,539, filed Jan. 31, 2024, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE DESCRIPTION The present description relates to agricultural machines. More specifically, the present description relates to controlling application of material to a field, using an agricultural machine. BACKGROUND There is a wide variety of different types of agricultural machines that apply material to an agricultural field. Some such agricultural machines include sprayers, tillage machines with side dressing bars, air seeders, and planters that have row units. As one example, a row unit is often mounted to a planter with a plurality other row units. The planter is often towed by a tractor over soil where seed is planted in the soil, using the row units. The row units on the planter follow the ground profile by using a combination of a down force assembly that imparts a down force to the row unit to push disk openers into the ground and gauge wheels to set depth of penetration of the disk openers. Row units can also be used to apply material to the field (e.g., fertilizer to the soil, to a seed, etc.) over which they are traveling. In some scenarios, each row unit has a valve that is coupled between a source of material to be applied, and an application assembly. As the valve is actuated, the material passes through the valve, from the source to the application assembly, and is applied to the field. Many current systems apply the material in a substantially continuous way. For instance, where the application machine is applying a liquid fertilizer, it actuates the valve to apply a substantially continuous strip of the liquid fertilizer. The same is true of materials that provide other liquid substances, or granular substances, as examples. Many current systems apply the material uniformly in ground surfaces as material is applied to the field. For instance, in examples where the application machine is applying fertilizer or water, the planting machine applies fertilizer or water uniformly to ground surfaces of various compositions. The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. SUMMARY An illustrative example of a planting machine includes a processing system, a moisture measurement device in communication with the processing system, a seed delivery system in communication with the processing system, and a water dispersion system in communication with the processing system. The processing system is configured to, receive one or more soil moisture measurement signals from the moisture measurement device, determine one or more water dispersion parameters based at least in part on a soil moisture measurement signal from the moisture measurement device, and transmit a control signal to one or more of the seed deliv",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Agricultural row crop planters typically include a seed hopper connected to a seed metering system that delivers seeds into a furrow formed by disc opener blades. The row crop planters are usually mounted in parallel along a tool bar which is attached to a tractor. There are typically multiple planting or row units disposed along the tool bar. For example, it is common to have 24 row units attached to a single tractor. The seeds are spaced in the ground through the metering system and seed tube. The metering system precisely singulates bulk seeds apart before dropping them into the ground, typically into a furrow cut by the opener blades. The typical row unit delivers seeds to the furrow without any attempt to maintain an orientation of the seed, or to control seed bouncing or tumbling. In order to optimize field production efforts have been made to change the delivery of the seed. The standard method of seed delivery is a gravity drop system whereby a seed tube has an inlet positioned below the seed metering system. A singulated seed then drops from the metering system, down the seed tube and into a trench (furrow) prepared by opener blades disposed forward of the seed tube. This method can raise issues with seed placement, seed spacing, and relative velocity of the seed as it hits the ground. Prior art methods for seed delivery improvement have focused on seed conveyors such as U.S. Pat. No. 8,789,482,  Seeding Machine with Seed Delivery System . Seed conveyors may include a brush belt that transports the seed from the seed metering system to the ground. This method moves the seed down to a discharge point closer to the ground and may accelerate the seed in a rearward direction thus eliminating much of the rolling of the seed in the trench (furrow). However, these types of methods do not orient the seed. A number of mechanical systems have attempted to better optimize seed placement. US Patent Publication 2019 0230846  Systems, Implements, and Methods For Seed Orientation With Adjustable Singulators During Planting,  describes a seed disk with a vision system for determining seed orientation.

FIELD OF THE DESCRIPTION The present description relates to agricultural machines. More specifically, the present description relates to controlling application of material to a field, using an agricultural machine. BACKGROUND There is a wide variety of different types of agricultural machines that apply material to an agricultural field. Some such agricultural machines include sprayers, tillage machines with side dressing bars, air seeders, and planters that have row units. As one example, a row unit is often mounted to a planter with a plurality other row units. The planter is often towed by a tractor over soil where seed is planted in the soil, using the row units. The row units on the planter follow the ground profile by using a combination of a down force assembly that imparts a down force to the row unit to push disk openers into the ground and gauge wheels to set depth of penetration of the disk openers. Row units can also be used to apply material to the field (e.g., fertilizer to the soil, to a seed, etc.) over which they are traveling. In some scenarios, each row unit has a valve that is coupled between a source of material to be applied, and an application assembly. As the valve is actuated, the material passes through the valve, from the source to the application assembly, and is applied to the field. Many current systems apply the material in a substantially continuous way. For instance, where the application machine is applying a liquid fertilizer, it actuates the valve to apply a substantially continuous strip of the liquid fertilizer. The same is true of materials that provide other liquid substances, or granular substances, as examples. Many current systems apply the material uniformly in ground surfaces as material is applied to the field. For instance, in examples where the application machine is applying fertilizer or water, the planting machine applies fertilizer or water uniformly to ground surfaces of various compositions. The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. SUMMARY In an illustrative example a planting machine includes a processing system, a moisture measurement device in communication with the processing system, a seed delivery system in communication with the processing system, and a material dispersion system in communication with the processing system. The processing system is configured to receive one or more soil moisture measurement signals from the soil moisture measurement device, determine one or more material dispersion parameters based at least in part on a moisture measurement signal, and transmit a control signal to one or more of the seed delivery system and the material disp",

    "description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure relates generally to gardening devices, and more particularly to planters suitable for furrowing and or planting seeds in a planting ground. BACKGROUND This disclosure relates to planters suitable for furrowing and or planting seed in a planting ground. In farming and gardening it is typically desired that seeds be planted in a manner so as to achieve high productivity. To achieve this, seeds need to be planted at particular depths and need to be spaced apart from each other by particular distances. For example, iceberg lettuce may need to be spaced ten inches apart to achieve a desired growth. Some types of seeds tend to germinate at a lower rate than others. For such types of seeds it is sometimes desired to plant groups of multiple seeds together and in close proximity to each other as insurance against non-germinating seeds, e.g. groups of two iceberg lettuce seeds, spaced two inches apart from each other, may be planted ten inches apart from each other. During planting season, achieving tight control over parameters such as those described above while maintain a high tempo of planting is challenging. In large-scale farming, seeds are commonly planted using large planting machines suitable for seeding multiple rows at a time. Plants planted by home gardeners and small farmers frequently show poorer performance because of lack of access to such automated planting machines; these machines tend to be complex, expensive, and often ill-suited for use on a small number of seed rows and or along short rows. Efficacious planters (planting devices) generally require the ability to handle a variety of seed sizes, and seed spacings along the planting ground (inter-speed spacings). Seeds are planted by first digging a hole or a furrow to a desired depth, then releasing one or more seeds, and then closing the hole or furrow. As mentioned above, furrows or holes need to be dug to a predetermined height. This height may depend on the type of seed that needs to be planted. Furrow openers are devices used to dig furrows (or  open  furrows). It is important for furrow openers to have the requisite rigidity to allow digging through the soil. For example, if not sufficiently rigid, furrow openers may bend and lead to failure in opening furrows or to improperly formed furrows. In many cases, the connection or coupling between the furrow opener and a handle or the rest of the planter may be insufficiently rigid, despite the furrow opener itself being highly rigid, e.g. the furrow opener may be made of steel, to yield a sufficiently rigid furrow opener. Furrow closers are devices used to close furrows. These are usually used in tandem with furrow openers to form and close a furrow or may be used on their own to close a pre-existing furrow. The furrow opener displaces a certain amount of soil from the ground to form the furrow. It is desired that the furrow closer replace that amount of soil back into the furrow in an appropriate manne",

    "description": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to seeding devices. More particularly, the present invention is related to a seeding assembly for direct seeding. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Excluding environmental factors, genetic factors, and seed quality, seeding machines are essential for controlling soil factors, where the seeding assembly is the heart of the seeding machine, and among the mechanical tasks it must perform are efficiently cutting the stubble; preparing a seeding band with superficial removal of 2.5 to 3 cm wide by 10 cm deep, where the seed will be placed; placing the seed with equidistant distribution and uniformity in depth; securing the seed at the bottom of the furrow, to ensure good seed soil contact that guarantees a good percentage and uniformity of emergence; and covering the seed, ideally by providing loose soil in the form of an inverted  V  over the row, with the fewest possible air pockets. The main objective of any seeding machine is to achieve good seeding, which can be defined as when the difference between the number of possible plants to obtain and the emerged plants is minimal, and where the separation between seeds is uniform and the time elapsed for emergence is minimal for the entire population. It is worth noting that uniformity in the distribution and depth of seeds during seeding helps ensure that, once the germination process begins, each seed germinates and emerges within 12-24 hours. Simultaneous emergence allows each plant to have the same resources, avoiding delayed and underdeveloped plants. Conversely, a plant that emerges one hour later than its neighboring plant, on average, loses 50  of the potential ear size, and a plant that emerges two hours later than its neighboring plants can lose up to 100  of its potential size. Plants with delayed emergence continuously lag throughout the growth cycle because they are hindered by a decrease in yield potential due to inefficient resource uptake. This lower performance of late-emerging plants is not compensated by the utilization of early-emerging dominant plants. To perform the mechanical tasks mentioned above, mechanical assemblies attached to the structure of the seeding frame are used in the prior art, such as those described below. The stubble is cut using a direct seeding equipment that includes a coulter blade which creates a micro-tillage in the soil. The coulter blade can have various shapes, undulations, and diameters, and it penetrates the soil cutting the stubble and generates a defined furrow bottom without exposing it and leaving a homogeneous removed zone. To prepare the seeding band or furrow with the appropriate conditions, a furrow opener assembly with double discs is used, which defines a V-shaped furrow that with gauge wheels allows placing the seed at the depth desired by the producer according to conditions of temperature, humidity, soil density, and type and quality of seed variety to be sown.

Provisional Patent Application 63 264,109,  Seed Delivery Device Comprising a Helical Channel and Related Row Units and Methods,  filed Nov. 16, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference FIELD Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to row units used on agricultural vehicles for planting an agricultural crop, and more particularly to seed-delivery systems. BACKGROUND Crop yields are affected by a variety of factors, such as seed placement, soil quality, weather, irrigation, and nutrient applications. Seeds are typically planted in trenches formed by discs or other mechanisms of a planter row unit. Depth of seed placement is important because seeds planted at different depths emerge at different times, resulting in uneven crop growth. Spacing of seeds can affect yield because plants that are too close together compete for nutrients, and plants too far apart leave wasted space between them. Orientation of seeds can affect time to plant emergence, and therefore, uniformity of plant growth. It would be beneficial to have improved methods of controlling the position and orientation of seeds placed in trenches so that seeds emerge and grow more uniformly. BRIEF SUMMARY In some embodiments, a seed-delivery device includes a seed meter having a metering disc configured to receive seeds, a seed tube coupled to the seed meter and having a helical channel formed in a wall thereof, an insert within the seed tube, and a drive mechanism configured to rotate the insert. The seed tube may have a generally cylindrical interior. In some embodiments, the insert includes a brush. The brush may include a plurality of resilient bristles extending radially from a center support. In other embodiments, the insert includes a generally cylindrical body, which may include a material selected from the group consisting of foam, rubber, and elastomers. The drive mechanism may include a variable-speed motor. The metering disc may be configured to provide the seeds to the seed tube in a preselected orientation.

    "description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to the field of agriculture, specifically to crop treatment. More particularly, the invention pertains to methods and devices for preparing agricultural crops for treatment. PRECEDING LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY Currently, a method for preparing to treat crops is known, in which concentrated liquids, such as pesticides, are diluted with water to the required concentration at stationary mixing units. The prepared spraying liquid is then transferred to the field by pumping it into a sprayer using a mobile pump. This method is inefficient because the vehicle transporting the spraying liquid has limited capacity. As a result, the amount of spraying liquid may be insufficient, or, if the tank is fully loaded, excessive for the field being treated. This creates the need for either partial delivery or returning excess liquid, leading to a loss of both time and additional resources, including machinery and labor. Another significant issue with known methods is the transportation of large volumes of water as part of the treatment solutions. Since the treatment solutions are transported in a ready-to-use form, a substantial amount of water must be hauled from a remote location to the field, even though in most cases, water is available near the field being treated. The objective set by the developer of method for preparing to treat crops is to develop a method and device that would save time required for crop treatment preparation, reduce the amount of equipment needed for this process, and lower labor costs. The technical result of claimed method for preparing to treat crops is the creation of a multi-system for mixing liquids for plant treatment or fertilization, saving time required for crop treatment preparation, reducing the amount of equipment needed for this process, and decreasing labor costs. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The essence of method for preparing to treat crops consists of the following: First, a mobile unit for preparing agricultural crops for treatment, equipped with a pump, liquid transfer hoses, a metered liquid delivery system, and at least two tanks, is transported to the field. One tank is filled with water, and the other is filled with a concentrated plant treatment or fertilization agent. The required concentration of the aforementioned treatment or fertilization agent for the specific field is then determined, after which the water is mixed with the concentrated agent in the necessary proportion, and the resulting solution is transferred to the destination. An additional tank may also be used for the intermediate storage of water mixed with the concentrated agent, and for the subsequent delivery of the prepared solution to the destination. If a crop treatment preparation device with 3 or more tanks is used, at least 2 of which are filled with different concentrated treatment or fertilization agents, in addition to determining the concentration, it is necessary to determine which agent or combination of ",

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not Applicable STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable THE NAMES OF THE PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not Applicable INCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC OR AS A TEXT FILE VIA THE OFFICE ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM Not Applicable STATEMENT REGARDING PRIOR DISCLOSURES BY THE INVENTOR OR JOINT INVENTOR Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (1) Field of the Invention The disclosure relates to lawn mowers and more particularly pertains to a new commercial lawn mower outlet cover for covering a grass outlet to permit mulching of grass and or leaves. For convenience, only grass will be discussed herein, although this disclosure relates to cutting any lawn debris or objects, including grass, leaves, weeds, and any other such objects. Commercial lawn mowers usually are designed with a grass outlet opening in the deck. Above this grass outlet opening is usually a vertical flange for guiding the mounting of mowing accessories, such as guide chutes, bagging structures, or even covering structures for mulching. Such accessories are usually connected in a pivotable fashion to a pair of mounting posts. The accessories can often be attached by screwing or clipping onto the mounting posts. While not a particularly challenging procedure, such changes take time and require the user to interrupt a mowing procedure for extended period of time. These stoppages cost the user in time and thus money, especially if the user is working on a property that requires multiple changes between regular cutting and mulching. In addition, even though the changes may not be overly difficult, they do require some skill and attention, which inexperienced users may not possess. Therefore, it would be advantageous to have a mulching cover that can be easily connected and disconnected with minimal effort and skill, and which is relatively inexpensive and durable. (2) Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98 The prior art relates to lawn mowers and lawn mower accessories. The prior art, as best understood, generally discloses mulching covers that are permanently attached to the deck of the lawn mower, some of which require modification of the mower itself from its original design. Some mulching covers are rather complex and thus expensive. Other mulching covers require a relatively time-consuming attachment procedure. The prior art, as best understood, does not disclose a mulching cover that can be easily connected to and disconnected from an unmodified lawnmower deck. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An embodiment of the disclosure meets the needs presented above in a commercial lawn mower outlet cover for covering a grass outlet opening to permit mulching of grass and or leaves that generally includes a cover plate and a bracket structure. The cover plate is rectangular and having a length and width sufficient to cover a grass",

    "description": "The invention relates to a cutting head for brush cutter machines. Machines exist within the field of machines for cutting vegetation which are called brush cutters, which cut the grass due to the centrifugal force transmitted to a tool, called a head, and to a cutting element mounted on the head. The brush cutter consists of a motor which transmits a rotary motion to a drive shaft in turn connected to the head. A rotating cutting element integral with the head protrudes outside the head and cuts the vegetation due to the centrifugal force induced by the head to the cutting element. There are different types of cutting elements, differentiated according to the type of vegetation to be cut, but the cutting edge is the preferred cutting element on the market for its high flexibility of use. In addition to allowing to cut different types of vegetation, a great advantage of the cutting edge is the accumulation of wire which the user can have inside the head. In fact, many heads have a wire spool inside which, as the wire segments outside the head wear out due to the impacts they have against the vegetation, by striking the head on the ground (or in some variations automatically), the user commands the exit of new wire segments for cutting. Another factor which differentiates the various brush cutters on the market is the type of power supply. In the professional field, brush cutters with a combustion engine are widely preferred, while in the hobby or domestic field, brush cutters with an electric motor are widely preferred. Although it tends to increase the overall weight of the brush cutter, the combustion engine allows to have greater power, so as to be able to cut different types of vegetation, and does not require any connection to the electrical network, a crucial factor since their use occurs in areas where electricity is not always available. On the other hand, the electric motor is preferable to the combustion engine because it does not aggravate the overall weight of the machine and because it is generally used in the courtyard areas near homes where it is easier to find electrical connections. For some years now, brush cutters provided with battery-powered electric motors have also been rapidly spreading. This latest generation of brush cutters has received strong interest both in the professional market and in the hobby market. In fact, in addition to being lightweight and easy to handle, the brush cutters with battery-powered electric motors do not require any electrical connection and therefore, in addition to not needing an electrical source connected to an electrical system, do not have electrical cables near the work area. The only problem, at least felt in the professional market, is the power of the electric motors which is generally lower than that delivered by combustion engines (often comparing the overall weight of the engine). Given that the current design criteria are increasingly seeking to optimise the shape and weight of th",

    "description": "The invention relates to a mower according to the preamble of Claim 1 . DE 1 945 760 U discloses a cutting bar for a mowing machine. The cutting bar has a plurality of mowing members positioned next to one another in a row, wherein the mowing members have cutter disks. The cutter disks of directly adjacent mowing members overlap in one projection, wherein the cutter disks of directly adjacent mowing members are arranged in different planes. Thus, in a working position of the mower, first cutter disks of first mowing members are arranged in a first, lower plane and second cutter disks of second mowing members are arranged in a second, upper plane. Furthermore, a housing with a transmission bar is shown, wherein chain wheels extend in the transmission bar of the housing and form a transmission for driving the cutter disks. In the working position of the mower, the transmission bar is arranged below the cutter disks. Mowed material can accumulate between the cutter disks and the transmission bar in the mower insert and cause blockages. There is a need for a mower that reduces the risk of cut crop collecting between the mower disks and the transmission bar, which can lead to blockages. EP 3 942 919 A1 shows an attachment for an agricultural harvester for harvesting maize or grain. The attachment has cutting devices and revolving driver devices during operation. Each driver device has driver elements arranged above the cutting devices for conveying cut crops. EP 3 143 865 B1 discloses a further mower according to the prior art, the mowing members of which, however, do not have cutter disks, but blade carriers with blades mounted on the blade carrier.

    "description": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT EP2023 058310 filed Mar. 30, 2023, claiming priority based on German Patent Application No. 10 2022 108 190.7 filed Apr. 5, 2022. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field The application relates to a method for monitoring a crop flow in a conveyor device for crop material of a harvesting machine and a harvesting machine. Background In combine harvesting, an even crop material intake is the basis for an even crop flow in the threshing units and thus for optimum utilization of the harvesting machine. EP 3 714 674 A1 describes a system and a method for controlling a combine harvester. The method comprises the steps of receiving grain flow sensor signals from a plurality of grain flow sensors, determining a current load on a shaker section based on the received grain flow sensor signals, and adjusting an aggressiveness setting of a threshing and separating section of the combine harvester based on the current load. The grain flow sensors are provided under and next to a crop transfer surface of the shaker section of the combine harvester and are distributed over a length of the shaker section. Short-term changes in harvesting conditions in the field as well as foreign objects or soil picked up by the cutting device can disrupt the crop flow. In combine harvesting, observation of the crop flow by the machine operator is the most common method for detecting crop flow disturbances in the cutting device. The trend towards ever wider working widths and ever higher forward speeds makes this task more difficult for the driver. One task can be to improve the monitoring of the crop flow. The problem is solved by a method and a harvesting machine. Embodiments are described in the sub-claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In the method for monitoring a crop flow in a conveyor device for crop material of a harvesting machine, an electrical or dielectric conductivity of the crop flow of the conveyed crop material is measured with at least one conductivity sensor in the conveyor device and a signal representing the measured conductivity is generated. The signal is analyzed with an evaluation device, wherein the crop flow is evaluated on the basis of a development of at least one of the following properties of the signal: Noise frequency, noise amplitude and base signal. The base signal corresponds to an average electrical conductivity of the crop flow. The currently measured conductivity varies greatly due to the movement, which is referred to as noise. Noise amplitude and noise frequency also vary within certain limits. A change in noise amplitude and noise frequency within the meaning of the application is given as soon as a predetermined threshold value of the change is reached. The method of monitoring the crop flow allows automatic detection of crop flow disturbances and offers the following benefits. On the one hand, the operator of the harvesting machine is",

    "description": "GENERAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains in general to unmanned autonomous tractors for completely autonomously crossing and cultivating farmland. BACKGROUND ART The adoption of technology in agriculture has improved the approaches that farmers use in the farmland nowadays. Modern agriculture has made it easy for farmers to achieve high produce while using less input. According the trends in the use of technology in agriculture, there are high concerns that the future of agriculture is bright. For example, mechanization in agriculture has reduced the overuse of manpower in doing some of the farming activities. As a consequence, agricultural machines have become bigger and bigger and more dedicated towards performing one type of cultivation. The introduction of autonomous tractors is considered a next step into the future of farming and it is expected that using autonomous tractors, the trend of bigger and more dedicated (specialised) farming machines will continue. Self-driving cars are common these days. Based on the trends in regards to the advancement of technology, it is expected that the technology will also be used for cultivating farmland. At present farmers in advanced countries are giving a tactical approach to how they plant, harvest, as well as maintain their crops. A good example of new tactical approaches is the use of autonomous tractors in agriculture. The concept of autonomous tractors can be traced back prior to the introduction of the concept of precision farming in the eighties. During these days, farmers used GPS technology as a guide to the tractors across the farmland. The aim of such an approach was the reduction of fuel consumption and enhancing the efficiency of the tractors and the farming activities. As such, these initial steps formed the basis for the development of autonomous tractors, following the introduction of technologies that improved communication over wireless devices. Autonomous tractors employ much the same approach as the driverless vehicles, i.e. using advanced control systems and sensors. With the inclusion of auto-steering abilities, such tractors have added control abilities. Evidently, the launch of the autonomous tractors is considerably a manifestation of the extended use of technology in farming. Benefits to farmers are obvious. It is an undeniable fact that farming is not an easy undertaking, it involves working for long hours and the subscription to hard labor in harsh weather conditions. Taking into consideration the common state of farmers, the majority of them have no employees to task them in the farmland and hence, have to do everything all by themselves. The autonomous tractors can be a positive outcome. Next to this, accuracy and precision are important aspects in agriculture in various aspects such as planting. Regarding for example such planting, the autonomous tractors can be equipped with automatic planting systems that ensure high accuracy when planting. With suc",

BACKGROUND When fruit farmers are picking fruits, they usually climb to the trees to pick the high fruits, which is often accompanied by danger; And some high fruits can t be picked even if they climb to the tree. At this time, people may choose to beat them with long poles or leave them on the tree. However, if a long pole is used, the fruit may be destroyed, or it may be smashed when it falls to the ground; this will cause economic losses to fruit farmers. In U.S. Pat. No. 31,961,972, a manual fruit picking basket is provided, which can be supported by a slender hand-held rod for continuously picking fruits from trees without a ladder or lowering the picking basket. The picking basket is basically cylindrical and includes an open upper end for receiving fruits, a lower end which defines a handle engaging socket; the handle engaging socket is suitable for receiving one end of an elongated hand-held rod for picking fruits high on a tree, and a central part defined between the upper end and the lower end, in which a position containing fruits is defined, the open upper end is defined by an edge, the upper end has a front part and a rear part; the front part comprises a basically open edge part, and the rear part comprises a plurality of spaced, elongated fruit engaging fingers, and the fingers extend upward beyond the edge, and have a hook-shaped structure so as to at least partially surround the fruit to be picked; an outlet located under the central part and fingers, wherein the outlet is located near the handle engaging socket but higher than the socket, and its diameter is such that fruits separated from fruit trees can pass through the outlet; and a slender tubular fruit conveying device suitable for being connected to a basket near the outlet, wherein the conveying device is made of elastic fabric, and the diameter of the outlet is usually smaller than that of the fruit to be picked, but the fruit can be stretched when it passes through the outlet from the central part of the basket and enters the conveying device; in use, the picking basket is usually placed at a certain angle with the ground, and the rear part of the upper end of the basket is closest to the ground, so that the fruit separated from the tree by fingers can move down along the fingers, move along the inside of the central part of the basket, then immediately roll to the outlet device and then move down along the conveying device.

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S) This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C.   119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application 63 626,744, filed Jan. 30, 2024, and entitled Grain Cart Unloading Sensor and Unload Control, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure relates to agricultural implements and positions sensors for use therewith. BACKGROUND It is understood by those skilled in the art that a grain cart is a mobile grain storage container used to unload a combine harvester. Grain carts are typically pulled by an agricultural tractor. The term  grain cart  hereinafter refers to the pulling tractor and the grain cart. A grain cart shuttles grain from the combine to another hauling vehicle parked at the field edge. The receiving or hauling vehicle is typically a truck or wagon suited to haul grain away from the field on a roadway. The term  truck  or  grain truck  hereinafter refers to the hauling truck or wagon. Most trucks have a tarp that can be rolled over the top of the grain container. It keeps the grain from blowing onto the roadway and protects the grain from precipitation (e.g. rain, snow, etc). Support members span across the grain container to provide a structure for the tarp to roll across. If grain is piled above the tarp supports, the tarp can not be able to close. The only resolution is for someone to climb on top of the grain pile and scoop the grain below the tarp support. This is an undesired, cumbersome task that slows down the trucking process. Therefore, grain cart operators try to keep the top of the grain pile at or below the tarp supports. The tractor operator makes two adjustments to set the unload rate. First, the operator sets the unload auger speed by adjusting the tractor engine RPM. The unloading auger is driven by the tractor s PTO shaft which is driven by the tractor engine. Increasing tractor engine RPM causes the unload auger RPM to increase. This dispenses more grain into the truck per unit of time. Decreasing engine RPM decreases the dispensing rate. Second, the operator opens a hydraulically actuated gate that controls the amount of grain that flows into the unload auger. Opening the gate increases the grain dispensing rate into the truck. Closing the gate decreases the dispensing rate. The operator uses a tractor SCV valve to adjust the gate opening. The normal practice is to start unloading at one end of the truck and move the grain cart forward (or backward) as the grain piles up in the truck. Experienced grain cart operators set and leave the gate fully open to hasten the unload. The difficulty is that the fast unload rate fills up the top part of the truck within seconds. A few seconds delay to pull ahead will pile grain above the tarp supports and or spill grain over the truck sides. This puts stress on the tractor operator to pull ahead at just the right moment, which requires an experienced operator. They don t usually s",

    "description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for controlling plant disease. BACKGROUND ART In a process of cultivating plants, it is known that, in order to control a disease, the plants are irradiated with near-infrared light (Patent Document 1). However, this method requires continuous irradiation all day long, and thus requires a large irradiation device equipped with multiple light sources to irradiate the entire cultivation area, resulting in problems with cost. In view of this, attempts have been made to reduce costs by efficiently utilizing light energy by optimizing near-infrared light irradiation conditions. CITATION LIST Patent Document Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 6061124 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Technical Problem However, near-infrared light irradiation is performed on the presumption that the entire plant is irradiated with near-infrared light. Thus, an increase in the size of an irradiation device is still an issue. In view of this, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel method for controlling a plant disease, with which light energy is more efficiently utilized and the size of an irradiation device can be further reduced. Solution to the Problem In order to achieve the aforementioned object, a disease control method according to an aspect of the present invention includes irradiating a shoot apex part of a plant with near infrared light.

    "description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a vertical farm system. In particular, the invention relates to a vertical farm system, especially for hydroponic or similar crops, with automatic management and with substantially vertical extension. PRIOR ART The processes triggered by humans, for example the massive use of fossil fuels and the intensive breeding of animals for slaughter or for dairy production, generate a considerable quantity of carbon dioxide which, once released into the atmosphere, becomes one of the main causes of global warming, inducing effects on the planet s climate. Various international government agencies have long been involved in providing guidelines and protocols to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions, even up to starting to reduce the carbon dioxide already present in the atmosphere. To this end, it is now standard practice to introduce pre-established quantities of carbon dioxide in greenhouse crops so as to accelerate and improve the production of the cultivated plants. The ventilation systems are configured to distribute a predetermined quantity of external air enriched with a flow of carbon dioxide from industrial plants. This practice allows to increase the productivity of the plants with a consequent reduction of the useful times for obtaining biomass. However, since the sowing, positioning and collection activities are managed by specialised personnel, the introduction of carbon dioxide in particularly significant quantities is not allowed at any time. In fact, to ensure the safety of people, the introduction of carbon dioxide must mainly occur at night, when the personnel are not operating inside the greenhouse. SUMMARY In this context, the technical task underlying the present invention is to propose a vertical farm system which obviates the drawbacks in the known art as described above. In particular, an object of the present invention is to provide a vertical farm system which can be safely used by a user. Another object of the present invention is to provide a vertical farm system configured to automatically manage each growth phase of the plant crops. Therefore, specifically, the invention has the object of providing a vertical farm system, in which the presence of man is not necessarily required during each growth phase of the plant crops. A further object of the present invention is to provide a vertical farm system configured to recycle at least part of the carbon dioxide present in the environment and or at least part of the carbon dioxide produced by industries. The stated technical task and specified objects are substantially achieved by a vertical farm system which comprises the technical features disclosed in the independent claim. The dependent claims correspond to further advantageous aspects of the invention. The invention relates to a vertical farm system.

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63 327,475, entitled  Dehumidifier Systems and Assemblies,  filed Apr. 5, 2022, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY The present technology relates generally to dehumidifiers, and more specifically to dehumidifier systems and assemblies for interior environments. BACKGROUND Various climate management strategies and systems are known for maintaining air quality and or managing humidity for the comfort of people in interior spaces. These include, inter alia, opening windows, use of air exchangers, and use of humidifiers or dehumidifiers. Such standard HVAC systems are generally designed around temperatures and humidity levels considered comfortable for daily human activity. When designing climate control systems for uses where desired temperatures and humidity levels are different from typical HVAC requirements, for example for greenhouses, different solutions are required. One standard practice for managing humidity, especially in semi-closed environments like greenhouses, is to open windows or louvers to an exterior of the environment to allow humid air to flow out and drier air to flow in. In cool or colder climate regions, the drier air could be colder or much colder than the humid air flowing out. When employing such a solution, the overall temperature of the interior environment will drop when exchanging air to reduce humidity. Additional heating is thus subsequently needed to return the interior environment to the desired temperature conditions, thereby increasing energy consumption and costs. U.S. Pat. No. 9,140,396, issued Sep. 22, 2015, presents another solution to humidity and climate management. A dehumidification apparatus is disclosed which uses a cooled core coupled to an external cooling source, providing a coolant fluid circulating through the cooled core. While the issue of losing heated air to an exterior is avoided, the solution requires the use of a coolant fluid in a refrigerant arrangement to cool air to induce condensation. In such refrigerant systems, the coolant fluids may evaporate, to the detriment of the environment. Large heat exchange apparatuses are also often need in order to cool the coolant fluid, often requiring substantial energy to run and occupying a large area floor area of the environment. Therefore, there remains a desire for solutions for managing humidity for interior environments. SUMMARY It is an object of the present technology to ameliorate at least some of the inconveniences present in the prior art. According to aspects of the present technology, a dehumidifier system is presented for managing humidity in an interior space, such as a semi-closed or closed environment. The system includes a centralized cold water supply, one or more dehumidifier assemblies, and a water collection system fluidly connected to the assemblies. Each dehumidifier assembly includes a h",

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a plant plug for germinating, cutting and or growing plants, a method of manufacturing such a plant plug and use thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Plant plugs, also known as rooting plugs, seed plugs or growth plugs, are well known for cultivation of plants, for example for germinating seeds, growing seedlings, cuttings and plants. Typically these plugs are made from a substrate material including organics and or non-organics and formed into a plug body having a substantially cylindrically shape around a cylinder axis, although other shapes e.g. rectangular blocks are also known. One plug type is comprised of natural substrate material like soil and or additional nutrients that contribute to cultivation. The materials are held together, e.g. using a suitable adhesive or carrier. Another plug type merely has the main function of providing a stable support for the seed or plant to be grown. Examples of the latter type include plant plugs made from mineral wool. Now EP172060A2 has disclosed a culture substrate for improving the development of plant organs, such as seedlings, consisting of a cylindrical plug. This plug having a diameter up to approximately 3 cm is formed from a material strip having long fibres carried on a support. The strip is folded on itself to form the cylindrical plug such that the long fibres are disposed radially relative to the axis of the plug. The two end lips of the strip are fastened to each other, for example by sewing, adhesive bonding or welding. For larger diameter plugs thicker strips, multiple coaxially arranged cylindrical strips or a spirally wound strip are contemplated. Disadvantages of this known plug are, amongst others, that the fibres are to be oriented radially on a support, which is a relative complex process to get the required fibre orientation; that the ends of the cut strip are to be connected mechanically or thermally requiring an additional manufacturing step and equipment; that the highest fibre density of the plug is at the centre thereof where the seedling is to be inserted, offering little space for inserting the seedling and a relative resistance to the development of roots; and that the support may form a barrier to the development of roots from the inside of the plug and uptake of water and nutrients from the outside of the plug. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention aims to overcome those disadvantages at least partly or to provide a usable alternative. In particular the present invention aims to provide a plug having a structure that reduces the relative resistance to root growth. Yet another object of the invention is to i",

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED DISCLOSURES This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 202311773374.2, filed on Dec. 21, 2023, entitled  A Method for Obtaining New Distant Germplasm of Intergeneric Hybridized Potato Based on Grafting-Mentor , which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to a technical field of potato breeding technology, specifically to a method for obtaining new distant germplasm of intergeneric hybridized potato based on a grafting-mentor. BACKGROUND Potatoes originated in the Andes of South America. Globally, the genetic base of cultivated species of potato is narrow, the potato experiences severe inbreeding depression and resistance breeding is limited by the resources. Lycium , as a member of the Solanaceae family like potato, is resistant to late blight, drought, and salinity, so that Lycium is regarded as a pioneer species for afforestation in saline-alkali soils. Grafting, a technique commonly used in agricultural and forestry production, plays a significant role in improving production efficiency, enhancing quality, preserving germplasm resources, introducing new mutant genes, and so on. Currently, late blight is one of the most significant diseases threatening potato production, and causing substantial losses to the industry every year. There are studies showing that genomic exchanges may occur between rootstocks and scions during grafting, and vascular bundles and plasmodesmata may provide conditions for horizontal gene transfer. Stegemann and Rock conduct reciprocal grafting by using two transgenic tobacco lines, and nuclear and plastid genes carried different markers and reporter genes. The detection of reporter genes demonstrated short-distance transfer of plastid genomes at the grafting interface. If disease resistance genes from Lycium could be transferred to potato plants via grafting, so as to obtain new germplasm resources or intermediate materials, new insights would be provided for researches on late blight resistance of potato. Ohta (1991) from Japan conducted years of experiments on grafting hybridization for peppers, and not only obtained graft hybrids, but also further studied them at a genetic level. According to the study by Ohta, some genetic variation on Mendelian characters after grafting has been found and it is further discovered that a mechanism by which these variations are induced is similar to transformation mechanism in higher organisms. Stegemann and Bock (2006) from Germany grafted two transgenic tobacco lines, and found that marker genes could frequently exchange between cells at the grafting site, which indicates that horizontal gene transfer occurs between rootstock and scion. Currently, there are no domestic or international reports on overcoming the barriers in sexual hybridization between distant plants of potatoes by using grafting mentor with potato as maternal parent and Lycium as male parent to obtain i",

BACKGROUND Plant pathogens are known to cause considerable damage to important crops, resulting in significant agricultural losses with widespread consequences for both the food supply and other industries that rely on plant materials. As such, there is a long felt need to reduce the incidence and or impact of agricultural pathogens on crop production. Several pathogens have been associated with damage to soybeans, which individually and collectively have the potential to cause significant yield losses in the United States and throughout the world. Exemplary pathogens include, but are not limited to fungi (e.g., genus Phytophthora and Asian Soybean rust Phakopsora pahyrhizi ), nematodes (e.g., genus Meloidogyne , particularly, Meloidogyne javanica ), and soybean stem canker. Given the significant threat to global food supplies that these pathogens present and the time and expense associated with treating soybean crops to prevent loss, new methods for producing pathogen resistant soybean cultivars are needed. What is needed is novel resistance genes (herein,  R-Genes ) that can be introduced into commercial soybean plants to control soybean pathogens SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compositions and methods for identifying, selecting and producing Glycine plants (including wild Glycines and Glycine max lines) with enhanced disease resistance are provided.

THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in the field of soybean cultivar breeding and development. The present invention particularly relates to the soybean cultivar AR1403091, EE1600274, EE1600891, EE1660258, EE1760174, EE1760847, and or EE1761104 and its seed, cells, germplasm, plant parts, and progeny, and its use in a breeding program. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Soybean Glycine max (L) is an important oil seed crop and a valuable field crop. However, it began as a wild plant. This plant and a number of other plants have been developed into valuable agricultural crops through years of breeding and development. The pace of the development of soybeans, into an animal foodstuff and as an oil seed has dramatically increased in the last one hundred years. Planned programs of soybean breeding have increased the growth, yield and environmental hardiness of the soybean germplasm. Due to the sexual reproduction traits of the soybean, the plant is basically self-pollinating. A self-pollinating plant permits pollen from one flower to be transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. Cross-pollination occurs when the flower is pollinated with pollen from a different plant; however, soybean cross-pollination is a rare occurrence in nature. Thus the growth and development of new soybean germplasm requires intervention by the breeder into the pollination of the soybean. The breeders  methods of intervening depends on the type of trait that is being bred. Soybeans are developed for a number of different types of traits including morphology (form and structure), phenotypic characteristics, and for traits like growth, day length, relative maturity, temperature requirements, initiation date of floral or reproductive development, fatty acid content, insect resistance, disease resistance, nematode resistance, fungal resistance, herbicide resistance, tolerance to various environmental factors like drought, heat, wet, cold, wind, adverse soil condition and also for yield. The genetic complexity of the trait often drives the selection of the breeding method. Due to the number of genes within each chromosome, millions of genetic combinations exist in the breeders  experimental soybean material. This genetic diversity is so vast that a breeder cannot produce the same two cultivars twice using the exact same starting parental material. Thus, developing a single variety of useful commercial soybean germplasm is highly unpredictable, and requires intensive research and development. The development of new soybeans comes through breeding techniques, such as: recurrent selection, mass selections, backcrossing, single seed descent and multiple seed procedure. Additionally, marker assisted breeding allows more accurate movement of desired alleles or eve",

No. 17 962,084, filed Oct. 7, 2022, which is a continuation and claims benefit of priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17 461,473, filed Aug. 30, 2021, now abandoned, the disclosures of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinctive soybean cultivar, designated 00450914. All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference. There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single cultivar an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include, but are not limited to, higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, altered fatty acid profile, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic quality. These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new cultivars is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction. Soybean ( Glycine max ), is an important and valuable field crop. Thus, a continuing goal of soybean plant breeding is to develop stable, high yielding soybean cultivars that are agronomically sound. The reasons for this goal are to maximize the amount of grain produced on the land used and to supply food for both animals and humans. To accomplish this goal, the soybean breeder must select and develop soybean plants that have the traits that result in superior varieties. The soybean is the world s leading source of vegetable oil and protein meal. The oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a typical composition of 11  palmitic, 4  stearic, 25  oleic, 50  linoleic, and 9  linolenic fatty acid content ( Economic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits Summary Report,  Iowa Soybean Promotion Board and American Soybean Association Special Report 92S (May 1990)). Changes in fatty acid composition for improved oxidative stability and nutrition are constantly sought after. Industrial uses of soybean oil, which is subjected to further processing, include ingredients for paints, plastics, fibers, detergents, cosmetics, lubricants, and biodiesel fuel. Soybean oil may ",

No. 17 962,067, filed Oct. 7, 2022, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17 461,453, filed Aug. 30, 2021, now abandoned, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinctive soybean cultivar, designated 04110514. All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference. There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single cultivar an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include, but are not limited to, higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, altered fatty acid profile, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic quality. These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new cultivars is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction. Soybean ( Glycine max ), is an important and valuable field crop. Thus, a continuing goal of soybean plant breeding is to develop stable, high yielding soybean cultivars that are agronomically sound. The reasons for this goal are to maximize the amount of grain produced on the land used and to supply food for both animals and humans. To accomplish this goal, the soybean breeder must select and develop soybean plants that have the traits that result in superior varieties. The soybean is the world s leading source of vegetable oil and protein meal. The oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a typical composition of 11  palmitic, 4  stearic, 25  oleic, 50  linoleic, and 9  linolenic fatty acid content ( Economic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits Summary Report,  Iowa Soybean Promotion Board and American Soybean Association Special Report 92S (May 1990)). Changes in fatty acid composition for improved oxidative stability and nutrition are constantly sought after. Industrial uses of soybean oil, which is subjected to further processing, include ingredients for paints, plastics, fibers, detergents, cosmetics, lubricants, and biodiesel fuel. Soybean oil may be split, inter-esterified, sulfurized, epoxidized,",

    "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 63 152,869, filed Feb. 24, 2021, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in the field of soybean cultivar breeding and development. The present invention particularly relates to the soybean cultivar CL1942258, CL1943627, and or CL1943668 and its seed, cells, germplasm, plant parts, and progeny, and its use in a breeding program. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Soybean Glycine max (L) is an important oil seed crop and a valuable field crop. However, it began as a wild plant. This plant and a number of other plants have been developed into valuable agricultural crops through years of breeding and development. The pace of the development of soybeans, into an animal foodstuff and as an oil seed has dramatically increased in the last one hundred years. Planned programs of soybean breeding have increased the growth, yield and environmental hardiness of the soybean germplasm. Due to the sexual reproduction traits of the soybean, the plant is basically self-pollinating. A self-pollinating plant permits pollen from one flower to be transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. Cross-pollination occurs when the flower is pollinated with pollen from a different plant; however, soybean cross-pollination is a rare occurrence in nature. Thus the growth and development of new soybean germplasm requires intervention by the breeder into the pollination of the soybean. The breeders  methods of intervening depends on the type of trait that is being bred. Soybeans are developed for a number of different types of traits including morphology (form and structure), phenotypic characteristics, and for traits like growth, day length, relative maturity, temperature requirements, initiation date of floral or reproductive development, fatty acid content, insect resistance, disease resistance, nematode resistance, fungal resistance, herbicide resistance, tolerance to various environmental factors like drought, heat, wet, cold, wind, adverse soil condition and also for yield. The genetic complexity of the trait often drives the selection of the breeding method. Due to the number of genes within each chromosome, millions of genetic combinations exist in the breeders  experimental soybean material. This genetic diversity is so vast that a breeder cannot produce the same two cultivars twice using the exact same starting parental material. Thus, developing a single variety of useful commercial soybean germplasm is highly unpredictable, and requires intensive research and development. The development of new soybeans comes through breeding techniques, such as: recurrent selection, mass selections, backcrossing, single seed descent and multiple seed procedure. Additionally, marker assisted breeding allows more accurate movement of desired alleles or even specific genes or sections of chromosomes",

    "description": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the field of plant breeding and, more specifically, to a new and distinctive strawberry variety, designated  FL 20.34-183 , and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof. All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference. Background of the Invention Strawberry ( Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) is cultivated and enjoyed globally for its health properties and flavor. The strawberry is one of the most widely distributed berry crops in the world. Production of strawberries was 8.9 million metric tons in 2020 (FAOSTAT, 2020) with 43  in Asia, 26.9  in the Americas, and 24  in Europe. In the United States, annualized production in California and Florida in open fields provides the bulk of supermarket strawberries, whereas high tunnel and greenhouse production systems predominate in Europe and some other regions. Commercial production is concentrated in relatively warm climatic areas that can provide fresh strawberries for much of the year. Strawberries are clonally multiplied via stolons or  runners . Thus, the vast majority of cultivars are clonal. While single varieties planted in monocultures readily self-pollinate during fruit production, selfing can result in severe inbreeding depression in the offspring (Shaw, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 90 (2), 237-241 (1995)). Thus, a pedigree breeding scheme is typical for strawberry, with full-sib crosses and even half-sib crosses often avoided. Visual evaluations are used for screening seedlings before clonal testing of selections provides the opportunity to screen for various traits and in multiple environments. As an allo-octoploid (2n 8  56) species, genetic studies have historically been complicated by a lack of molecular marker and other genomic resources. However, recent studies have significantly advances strawberry genomics and breeding research. See, e.g. Bassil et al., Genomics, 16 (1), 1310 (2015); Edger et al., Nature Genetics, 51 (3), 541-547 (2019); and Hardigan et al., Frontiers in Plant Science, 10, 1789 (2019). Improvements in agronomic performance and fruit quality attributes highlight the successes of strawberry breeding in recent decades. Nevertheless, sweetness and flavor continue to fall below the ideal for the average consumer. Flavor is therefore an important trait of focus during variety development, and is one of many critical traits necessary for the success of a strawberry variety. Strawberry breeders must also take into consideration, e.g. fruit yield, fruit size, fruit shape, time of flowering and fruiting, fruit firmness, and disease resistance. Thus, a continuing need exists in the art to develop new strawberry varieties with desirable combinations of agronomic characteristics including improved flavor intensity and complexity.
